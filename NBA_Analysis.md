<img src="images/NBA_Analysis_cover.png"/>

## Let's Get Started!

When I ask individuals what their favorite basketball team is, I typically hear a similar response: team 'X' because that is the area that I grew up in or been living in. I am no different. When asked the same question, I respond with: the LA Lakers because that is the area that I grew up in. 

In this analysis, I examine the NBA 21-22 season data to get some insights to the teams and players data. In my analysis, I found that:

  - Point guards generally have the highest points and assists, and Nikola Jokic is an outlier with having higher assists, rebounds and points compared to other center's.
  - The power forward position from the Sacramento Kings had a 50% 3 pointer average, the highest average out of all of the teams.
  - The Minnesota Timberwolves had the highest total points scored and Trae Young from the Atlanta Hawks had the highest amount of points scored.
  - Point guards have the highest number of assists with Trae Young having the highest number of assists.

## The Data

## The Analysis
 
### NBA players performance on total points, total assists, & total rebounds. 

The first item I analyzed was the NBA players total points, assists and rebounds. I created a bubble plot that measures all three points of interest with assists and points being measured in the graph, rebounds measured by the size of the data point, and each color representing different player positions.

The graph shows that point guards have the highest points and assists while centers have the lowest. Nikola Jokic appears to be an outlier having greater than usual rebounds, assists, and points compared to other players in his position as a center. 


### What position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?

The next item that I looked at was finding which position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team. To easily view this data, I created a table that identifies the average 3 point % for each position in each team.

The results show that the power forward from the Sacramento Kings had a 50% 3 point average which ws the highest average out of all of the teams.


### Break down the total points scored by each team and players.

I next analyzed the total points scored by each player per team by using a stacked bar chart.

The results show that the Minnesota Timberwolves had the highest total points scored with Karl-Anthony Towns scoring the most within the team with 1,818 points. After further analysis, Trae Young from the Atlanta Hawks is the player that had the highest amount of points scored with 2,155.


### Players with the most assists per position.

The last item was to identify the number of assists for each position and player. The treemap below is divided into five colors with each color is assigned a position and each position is subdivided for each player that holds that position.
