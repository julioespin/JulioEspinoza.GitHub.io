## Let's Get Started!

As someone who has experience in the healthcare field, I thought that it would be interesting to analyze some healthcare data. In this project, I used SQL to analyze healthcare data and focused on getting insights into the following questions:

  - Do the majority of patients stay in the hospital for less than 7 days?

## The Data
I used [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julio.espinoza/viz/21-22NBAAnalysis/21-22NBAAnalysis) to analyze 21-22 NBA data and the dateset can be found [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html).

## The Analysis
 
### NBA players performance on total points, total assists, & total rebounds. 

The first item I analyzed was the NBA players total points, assists and rebounds. I created a bubble plot that measures all three points of interest with assists and points being measured in the graph, rebounds measured by the size of the data point, and each color representing different player positions.

We notice that point guards have the highest points and assists while centers have the lowest. We also notice a Nikola Jokic is an outlier having greater than usual rebounds, assists, and points compared to other players in his position as a center. 


### What position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team.

The next item that I looked at was finding which position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team. To easily view this data, I created a table that identifies the average 3 point % for each position in each team.

The results show that the power forward from the Sacramento Kings had the highest average 3 point % with 50%. 


### Break down the total points scored by each team and players.
