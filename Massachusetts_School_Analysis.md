## Let's Get Started!

Growing up, my parents knew the value of a proper education and always encouraged us to pursue higher education. My parents have different educational backgrounds: my mother was the first in the family to go to college, while my father never made it past the 6th grade. It was very common that a child in a small town of a latin american country to start working at a young age to help support their family.

This got me interested in looking at an education case study and I was able to learn some key insights into the performance of schools in Massachusetts based on key performance indicators (KPI) that was requested by the superintendent.

### Key Insights

After my analysis, I learned that: 

  - The bottom 10 schools with the lowest graduation rates range from 0-18.2%.
  - Class sizes between 12-20 students have higher college attendance and plateaus
  -Students that are economically disadvantaged have lower college attendance/Economically disadvantaged students are less likely to attend college
  - 4 Schools are at or above the 50% passing threshold in mathematics(can later talk about how further research can be made to these schools to see how they have higher success rates.

## The Data

The dataset was provided as an Excel (MA_Schools.xlsx) file and consists of 1861 rows and connected to [Tableau](https://www.datacareerjumpstart.com/products/the-data-science-project-studio/categories/2150357707/posts/2158441592) for analysis. 

## The Analysis

The first KPI that we looked at was the lowest graduation rates for the different schools in Massachusetts to determine which schools were struggling the most. Using the bar graph below, we see that the bottom 10 graudation rates range from 0-18.2%.

The next KPI was looking at how class sizes affects college attendance. It is believed that smaller class size would increase the % of students that go to college. To confirm, we analyzed the data by creating a scatter plot to show the relationship between class size and student attendance. We see that a 12-20 student class size range provides the highest concentration of students attending college and there does not appear to be significant attendance if class sizes were outside of this range. 

Within the same scatter plot, we looked at college attendace for students that are economically disadvantaged. We see that those that are less econmically diadvantaged have a higher rate of attending college.

The last KPI we looked at was the students 4th grade math scores. The superintendent believes that 4th grade math is key to a students future success and would like to improve the states 4th grade math scores. We created a bar graph, to show the average % of 4th grade math scores with a passing threshold of 50% or higher. We see that there are only 4 districts that meet or exceed that threshold. These schools are:

  -Community Day Charter Public School-R. Kingman Webster
  -Community Day Charter Public School-Prospect 
  -Community Day Charter Public School-Gateway 
  -Orleans

## Results and Recommendation

We looked at different KPI's for Massachusetts schools and see how they affect college attendance after high school. We see that there is a total of 1,861 schools and a total of 953,748 students throughout the state of Massachusetts. We first looked at the graduation rates and found that graduation rates range from 0-18.2%. Next we analyzed class size to find that class sizes between 12-20 students have the highest concentration of students attending college and those that are more economically disadvantaged are less likely to attend college. Finally, we found 4 districts that meet or exceed the passing threshold for 4th grade math.

It is recommended that further analysis should be made to determine the reason or other contributing factors for low graduation rates. After further analysis, a decision can be made to improve graduation rates for the schools. Class sizes should remain within the range oof 12-20 students as there is no major improvement for college attendance if outside of that range. It is also reccommended that the teachers in districts with passing math scores be invited to train the rest of the state to improve math scores.
