##Let's Get Started!

Growing up, my parents knew the value of a proper education and always encouraged us to pursue higher education. My parents have different educational backgrounds: my mother was the first in the family to go to college for her associates, while my father never made it past the 6th grade. It was very common that someone in a small town to start working at such a young age to help support their family. My parents never had the opportunity to continue with their studes, but encouraged us to do so. 

This got me interested in looking at an education case study and I was able to learn some key insights into the performance of schools in Massachussetts based on key performance indicators (KPI).

###Key Insights

After my analysis, I learned that: 

  - The bottom 10 schools with the lowest graduation rates range from 0-18.2%.
  - Class sizes between 12-20 students have higher college attendance and plateaus
    -Students that are economically disadvantaged have lower college attendance/Economically disadvantaged students are less likely to attend college
  - 4 Schools are at or above the 50% passing threshold in mathematics(can later talk about how further research can be made to these schools to see how they have higher success rates.

##The Data

The dataset was provided as an Excel (MA_Schools.xlsx) file and consists of 1861 rows and uploaded to Tableau for analysis. 

##The Analysis

The first KPI that we looked at was the lowest graduation rates for the different schools in Massachusetts to determine which schools were struggling the most. Using the bar graph below, we see that the bottom 10 graudation rates range from 0-18.2%.

The next KPI analyzed was whether class sizes affects college attendance after high school. It is believed that lowering the average class size would increase the % of students that go to college. To analyze that data, I created a scatter plot to show the relationship between class size and student attendance. We are able to see that a range of 12-20 student class size provides the highest concentration of students attending college and there does not appear to be significant improvements if class sizes were outside of this range. 

Within the same scatter plot, we also looked at the average % of economically disadvantaged students. We see that those that are less econmically diadvantaged have a higher rate of attending college.

The last KPI we looked at was the students 4th grade math scores. The superintendent believes that 4th grade math is key to a students future success and would like to improve the states 4th grade math scores. In the below bar graph, the passing threshold is listed at or above 50%. We see that there are only 4 districts that meet or exceed that threshold. These schools are:
  -Community Day Charter Public School- R. Kingman Webster
  -Community Day Charter Public School - Prospect 
  -Community Day Charter Public School -Gateway 
  -Orleans

##Results and Recommendation

We looked at different KPI's for Massachussetts schools and see how they affect college attendance after high school. We first look at the graduation rates and found that graduation rates range from 0-18.2%. Next we analyzed class size to discover that class sizes between 12-20 students have the highest concentration of college attendance. In tandem, we determined that students are less likely to attend college if they are economically disadvantaged. Finally, we found 4 districts that meet or exceed the passing threshold for 4th grade math. 

It is recommended that further analysis should be made to determine the reason or contributing factors for low graduation rates. After further analysis, a decision can be made to improve graduation rates for the schools. .Class sizes should remain within the range oof 12-20 students as there is not major college attendance improvement outside of that range. It is also reccommended that the teachers in districts with passing math scores be invited to train the rest of the state to improve math scores.

------For this project, you will pretend that you were recently hired by the State of Massachusetts to analyze their education data. The school superintendent is looking for the following:

A report to show the school board the state of the school system 

###HOW Does class size affect college admission?/The superintendent is wondering how college attendance would be increased. They're considering investing in building more schools in aim of lowering the average class size to hopefully increase the % attending college. Would you recommend the state build more schools for this purpose? 

###What are the top math schools in the state?/The superintendent believes that 4th grade math is key to a student's feature & would like to focus on improving the state's MCAS 4thGrade Math P value (P stands for passing). They want to know which districts are above the desired threshold of 50% & would like to collect the names of these districts to invite some of these teachers to train the rest of the state on how they improve math scores. 

###What schools are struggling he most?/ The super intendant wants to know what are the bottom 10 high schools in terms of graduation %

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```
