# NBA 21-22 Season Analysis - Purifying Iron from Dirty Data

<img src="images/NBA_Analysis_cover.png"/>

## Let's Get Started!

Picture this: You are out in the field and collect a sample of dirt but you are curious to know how much of your sample contains iron? You start to think about ways to separate iron from other impurities of the sample and then remember an article that discussed this process. The answer? **froth flotation**. In the mining industry, froth flotation is a process used to purify minerals from unwanted materials. This process involves mixing the sample in an aqueous solution and then coating the mineral with a coating agent that makes them repefll water. The mixture is then injected with air bubbles that causes the material of interest (the one with the coating agent) to float towards the top and creates a froth. The froth can be then separated from the rest of the material.  


In this analysis, I examine the % Iron Concentrare from a flotation plant to determine the purity of the iron sample. In my analysis, I found that

  - Point guards generally have the highest points and assists, and Nikola Jokic is an outlier with having higher assists, rebounds and points compared to other center's.
  - The power forward position from the Sacramento Kings had a 50% 3 pointer average, the highest average out of all of the teams.
  - The Minnesota Timberwolves had the highest total points scored and Trae Young from the Atlanta Hawks had the highest amount of points scored.
  - Point guards have the highest number of assists with Trae Young having the highest number of assists.

## The Data
I used Deepnote, a browser IDE (Interactive Development Environment) that allows the use of Python, to analyze mining information from March 2017 to September 2017. The dateset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process?resource=download).

## The Analysis
 
### NBA players performance on total points, total assists, & total rebounds. 

The first item I analyzed was the NBA players total points, assists and rebounds. I created a bubble plot that measures all three points of interest with assists and points being measured in the graph, rebounds measured by the size of the data point, and each color representing different player positions.

The graph shows that point guards have the highest points and assists while centers have the lowest. Nikola Jokic appears to be an outlier having greater than usual rebounds, assists, and points compared to other players in his position as a center. 


### What position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team?

The next item that I looked at was finding which position was the most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for every team. To easily view this data, I created a table that identifies the average 3 point % for each position in each team.

The results show that the power forward from the Sacramento Kings had a 50% 3 point average which ws the highest average out of all of the teams.


### Break down the total points scored by each team and players.

I next analyzed the total points scored by each player per team by using a stacked bar chart.

The results show that the Minnesota Timberwolves had the highest total points scored with Karl-Anthony Towns scoring the most within the team with 1,818 points. After further analysis, Trae Young from the Atlanta Hawks is the player that had the highest amount of points scored with 2,155.


### Players with the most assists per position.

The last item was to identify the number of assists for each position and player. The treemap below is divided into five colors with each color is assigned a position and each position is subdivided for each player that holds that position.

The treemap shows that point guards have the highet assists with Trae Young having the highest number of assists.

## Results

There is a lot of data that can be gathered from basketball data. I analyzed the data to gain some insights to the NBA 21-22 season and I found that: point guards score the most and have the most assists, with Nikola Jokic as an outlier having higher assists, rebounds and points compared to other center's; the power forward position from the Sacramento Kings had a 50% average for 3 pointers; the Minnesota Timberwolves had the highest total points scored and Trae Young from the Atlanta Hawks is the player that scored the most; and point guards have the highest number of assists with Trae Young having the highest number of assists.
