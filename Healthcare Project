## Let's Get Started!



### Key Insights

After my analysis, I found that: 

  - The majority of patients stay less than 7 days
  - 

✅ CASE WHEN

Your boss has asked you to explore the relationship between number of lab procedures and time spent in the hospital. Specifically, they asked for a few, average, and many procedure group.

 ✅ Subqueries + WITH (CTE's)  

Provide a list of all patients who had an emergency but left the hospital faster than the average.

✅ UNION

Research needs a list of all patient numbers who are African-America or have a "Up" to metformin

✅ HISTOGRAMS

Our health care data analyst boss wants to know what the distribution of time spent in the hospital looks like. 

They're also curious to know if the majority stay less than 7 days. Once patients stay over 7 days, the hospital wants to ensure these patients are very acute.

✅ HAVING

Give the hospital director a list of the medical specialties that have an average number of procedure count above 2.5 with the total procedure count above 50.

✅ JOIN

The nurse director needs to know if we are subconsciously treating races differently. Show the average number of lab procedures broken down by race.

## The Analysis
 
### Do the majority of patient stay for less than 7 days?

The first data point I analyzed was determining whether the majority of patients stay less than 7 days. This is an important factor to help with forcasting for new admissions. I used the SQL statement below to create a histogram for a patients length of stay.

I found that the majority of patients stay at the hospital for less than 7 days, with the most of patients staying for 3 days. 

Having sufficient space available is critical in determining whether a hospital can admit new patients. Determining the length of stay of patients can help with forcasting for the capability of new admissions.

### What medical specialties are doing the most number of average procedures?

The next thing I looked at determining what medical specialties are doing the most average number of procedures. Using the SQL statement below to find that informmation.

-------Image Results

We see that the SQL statement was able to provide a short list of 5 medical specialties that have an average number of procedures greater than 2.5.

### The nurse director needs to know if we are subconsciously treating races differently. Show the average number of lab procedures broken down by race.

To do this I first used the *JOIN* command to combine two tables that have a common column and contain the information that I am looking for. I have a table that contains a patient's health and treatment, while the other table contains demographic data. These two tables are related via a column named patient_nbr that is a unique patient ID number given to every patient.

-----image results

The results show that the average number of procedures range from 41.82 - 44.46. There does not appear to be a gap between the number of procedures between each race. 

The Chief of Nursing wants to know if the hospital seems to be treating patients of different races differently, specifically with the number of lab procedures done.
