# World Bank Data Analysis

## Let's Get Started!

Money, money, money makes the world go round. 

In this project I analyze the [International Develpment Association's](https://ida.worldbank.org/en/what-is-ida) (IDA) loans data to provide some insight. The IDA is part of the World Bank and provides low interest loans to poor countries to help reduce poverty.

The stakeholder was interested in specific information from the dataset. The following are the questions of interest that will be answered in my analysis: 

  - Show us all transactions from the Nicaragua (the country).
  - How many total transactions? 
  - How many total transactions per country?? 
  - What is the max owed to the IDA?
  - Which was the most recent to pay?
  - Which country has the most loans?

## The Data

The dataset was provided as a [CSV](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx) file that consists of 1,109,994 rows, and SQL was used for analysis.

## The Analysis

### Show us all transactions from the Nicaragua (the country)

The first question I looked into was finding all transactions from Nicaragua. Using the SQL statement below, I was able to pull all transactions that were from Nicaragua.

We also see that there was a total of 13,704 rows of data that are transactions from Nicaragua.

### How many total transactions? 

The next item we looked at was the total transactions to date under the IDA.

## Results and Recommendation

Different KPI's for Massachusetts schools were observed to see how they affect college attendance. There is a total of 1,861 schools and a total of 953,748 students throughout the state of Massachusetts. Graduation rates were observed and found that the lowest 10 schools had graduation rates of 0-18.2%. Next we found that class sizes between 12-20 students have the highest concentration of students attending college and those that are more economically disadvantaged are less likely to attend college. Finally, we found 4 districts that meet or exceed the passing threshold for 4th grade math.

It is recommended thata class sizes should remain within the range of 12-20 students as there is no major improvement for college attendance if outside of that range. It is also recommended that the teachers in districts with passing math scores be invited to train the rest of the schools to improve math scores. Further analysis should be made to determine other contributing factors for low graduation rates. After further analysis, a decision can be made to improve graduation rates for the schools.
